# Helenus

  NodeJS Bindings for Cassandra

  Currently the driver has full CQL support and a growing support for thrift (non-cql) commands.

### Build Status

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simplereach/helenus.png)](http://travis-ci.org/simplereach/helenus)

## Installation

    npm install helenus

## Running Tests

  Ensure cassandra is running on localhost:9160.

    make test

  For coverage

    make test-cov

## Usage

## CQL

```javascript
  var helenus = require('helenus'),
      pool = new helenus.ConnectionPool({
        hosts      : ['localhost:9160'],
        keyspace   : 'helenus_test',
        user       : 'test',
        password   : 'test1233',
        timeout    : 3000
        //cqlVersion : '3.0.0' // specify this if you're using Cassandra 1.1 and want to use CQL 3
      });

  //if you don't listen for error, it will bubble up to `process.uncaughtException`
  //pools act just like connection objects, so you dont have to worry about api
  //differences when using either the pool or the connection
  pool.on('error', function(err){
    console.error(err.name, err.message);
  });

  //makes a connection to the pool, this will return once there is at least one
  //valid connection, other connections may still be pending
  pool.connect(function(err, keyspace){
    if(err){
      throw(err);
    } else {
      //to use cql, access the pool object once connected
      //the first argument is the CQL string, the second is an `Array` of items
      //to interpolate into the format string, the last is the callback
      //for formatting specific see `http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/util.html#util.format`
      //results is an array of row objects

      pool.cql("SELECT col FROM cf_one WHERE key = ?", ['key123'], function(err, results){
        console.log(err, results);
      });

      //NOTE:
      //- You can always skip quotes around placeholders, they are added automatically.
      //- In CQL 3 you cannot use placeholders for ColumnFamily names or Column names.
    }
  });
```

## Thrift

If you do not want to use CQL, you can make calls using the thrift driver

```javascript
  pool.connect(function(err, keyspace){
    if(err){
      throw(err);
    }

    //first retreive the column family from the server
    //helenus will cache column families it has already seen
    keyspace.get('my_cf', function(err, cf){
      if(err){
        throw(err);
      }

      //insert something into the column family
      cf.insert('foo', {'bar':'baz'}, function(err){
        if(err){
          throw(err);
        }

        //get what we just put in
        //the driver will return a Helenus.Row object just like CQL
        cf.get('foo', function(err, row){
          if(err){
            throw(err);
          }

          row.get('bar').value // => baz
        });
      });
    });

  });
```

### Thrift Support

Currently Helenus supports the following command for the thrift side of the driver:

  * connection.createKeyspace
  * connection.dropKeyspace
  * keyspace.createColumnFamily
  * keyspace.dropColumnFamily
  * columnFamily.insert
  * columnFamily.get
  * columnFamily.getIndexed
  * columnFamily.remove
  * columnFamily.truncate

The following support is going to be added in later releases:

  * columnFamily.rowCount
  * columnFamily.columnCount
  * columnfamily.increment
  * SuperColumns
  * CounterColumns
  * Better composite support

## Row

The Helenus Row object acts like an array but contains some helper methods to
make your life a bit easier when dealing with dynamic columns in Cassandra

### row.count

Returns the number of columns in the row

### row[N]

This will return the column at index N

    results.forEach(function(row){
      //gets the 5th column of each row
      console.log(row[5]);
    });

### row.get(name)

This will return the column with a specific name

    results.forEach(function(row){
      //gets the column with the name 'foo' of each row
      console.log(row.get('foo'));
    });

### row.forEach()

This is wrapper function of Array.forEach which return name,value,ts,ttl of column from row as callback params.

    results.forEach(function(row){
      //all row of result
      row.forEach(function(name,value,ts,ttl){
        //all column of row
        console.log(name,value,ts,ttl);
      });

    });

### row.slice(start, finish)

Slices columns in the row based on their numeric index, this allows you to get
columns x through y, it returns a Helenus row object of columns that match the slice.

    results.forEach(function(row){
      //gets the first 5 columns of each row
      console.log(row.slice(0,5));
    });

### row.nameSlice(start, finish)

Slices the columns based on part of their column name. returns a helenus row of columns
that match the slice

    results.forEach(function(row){
      //gets all columns that start with a, b, c, or d
      console.log(row.nameSlice('a','e'));
    });

## Column

Columns are returned as objects with the following structure:

```javascript
  {
    name: 'Foo',       //The column name
    value: 'bar',      //The column value
    timestamp: Date(), //The date object of the timestamp for the column
    ttl: 123456        //The ttl (in milliseconds) for the columns
  }
```
